# dl-2024-2
Course about Deep Learning from Institute of Computing at the Federal University of Alagoas.

# Objective
To provide students with a deep understanding of the concepts, architectures, and algorithms used in neural networks and deep learning. Students will learn to design, train, and evaluate neural network models, including perceptrons, deep neural networks, and convolutional networks, using modern frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

# Syllabus
- Introduction to Neural Networks: History, biological inspiration, and early neuron models.
- Perceptrons and Simple Neural Networks: Single-layer perceptron, delta rule, activation function, and linearly separable problems.
- Linear and Logistic Regression with Neural Networks: Implementation of linear and logistic regression using neural networks.
- Training Neural Networks: Cost functions, gradient descent, backpropagation, and optimization.
- Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): Structure of deep networks, advanced activation functions, regularization, and dropout.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Convolutional layers, pooling, classic architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet).
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): LSTMs, GRUs, and applications in time series and natural language processing.
- Advanced Topics in Deep Learning: Generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoencoder networks, and transformers.
- Practical Implementation: Using TensorFlow and PyTorch to build, train, and evaluate neural network models.
- Final Projects: Development of an MVP using neural networks in a real-world pattern recognition problem.
